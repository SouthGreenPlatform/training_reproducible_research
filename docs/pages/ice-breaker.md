In each group you will have to choose a person who will take notes, and make a quick report to everyone at the end of this session.


**Topics for discussion in breakout rooms:**  

* Do you organize your work in distinct projects?
* How do you organize your files in this context?
* Are you happy with the way you work today?
* Does your group have a data management plan in place?
* Do you know "your" repositories and how to submit data to them?
