As you might remember from the [intro](../../introduction/introduction_rr/), we are attempting to
understand how lytic bacteriophages can be used as a future therapy for the
multiresistant bacteria MRSA (methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_).
We have already seen how to define the project environment in the [Conda
tutorial](../../conda/conda-3-projects) and how to set up the workflow in the [Snakemake
tutorial](../../snakemake/snakemake-10-generalizing-workflows). Here we explore the results
from the Snakemake tutorial and generate a Supplementary Material file with
some basic stats.

In the `training-reproducible-research/tutorials/jupyter/` directory you will
find a notebook called `supplementary_material.ipynb`. Open this notebook with
Jupyter by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook supplementary_material.ipynb
```

!!! Tip
    Using what you've learned about markdown in notebooks, add headers
    and descriptive text to subdivide sections as you add them. This will
    help you train how to structure and keep note of your work with a
    notebook.

You will see that the notebook contains only a little markdown text and a code
cell with a function `get_geodata`. We'll start by adding a cell with some
import statements.

Run the cell with the `get_geodata` function and add a new cell directly after
it. Then add the following to the new cell:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

This imports the `pandas` (for working with tables), `seaborn` and
`matplotlib.pyplot` (for plotting) and `numpy` (for numerical operations)
Python modules.

Also add:

```python
import matplotlib_inline
matplotlib_inline.backend_inline.set_matplotlib_formats('pdf', 'svg')
```

to set high-quality output for plots.

Run the cell and create a new one below it.

In the next cell we'll define some parameters to use for the notebook:

```python
counts_file="results/tables/counts.tsv"
summary_file="results/tables/counts.tsv.summary"
multiqc_file="intermediate/multiqc_general_stats.txt"
rulegraph_file="results/rulegraph.png"
SRR_IDs=["SRR935090","SRR935091","SRR935092"]
GSM_IDs=["GSM1186459","GSM1186460","GSM1186461"]
GEO_ID="GSE48896"
```

As you can see we add paths to results files and define lists with some sample
IDS. Run this cell and add a new one below it.

Next, we'll fetch some sample information from NCBI using the `get_geodata`
function defined at the start of the notebook and collate it into a dataframe.

```python
id_df = pd.DataFrame(data=GSM_IDs, index=SRR_IDs, columns=["geo_accession"])
geo_df = get_geodata(GEO_ID)
name_df = pd.merge(id_df, geo_df, left_on="geo_accession", right_index=True)
# Create a dictionary to rename sample ids in downstream plots
name_dict = name_df.to_dict()
```

Run the cell and take a look at the contents of the `name_df` dataframe (_e.g._
run a cell with that variable only to output it below the cell).

Now we'll load some statistics from the QC part of the workflow, specifically
the 'general_stats' file from `multiqc`. Add the following to a new cell and run
it:

```python
qc = pd.read_csv(multiqc_file, sep="\t")
qc.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace("FastQC_mqc-generalstats-fastqc-", "").replace("_", " "), inplace=True)
qc = pd.merge(qc, name_df, left_on="Sample", right_index=True)
qc
```

In the code above we load the multiqc file, rename the columns by stripping the
`FastQC_mqc-generalstats-fastqc-` part from column names and replace underscores
with spaces. Finally the table is merged with the information obtained in the
step above and output to show summary statistics from the QC stage.

Next it's time to start loading gene count results from the workflow. Start by
reading the counts and summary results, then edit the columns and index:

```python
# Read count data
counts = pd.read_csv(counts_file, sep="\t", header=0, comment="#", index_col=0)
# Read summary data
counts_summary = pd.read_csv(summary_file, sep="\t", index_col=0)
# Rename columns to extract SRR ids
counts.rename(columns = lambda x: x.split("/")[-1].replace(".sorted.bam",""), inplace=True)
counts_summary.rename(columns = lambda x: x.split("/")[-1].replace(".sorted.bam",""), inplace=True)
```

Take a look at the `counts` dataframe to get an idea of the data structure. As
you can see the dataframe shows genes as rows while the columns shows various
information such as start and stop, strand and length of the genes. The last
three columns contain counts of the genes in each of the samples.

If you have a look at the `counts_summary` dataframe you will see statistics
from the read assignment step, showing number of reads that could be properly
assigned as well as number of reads that could not be assigned to genes for
various reasons.

Now let's generate a barplot of the summary statistics. Before we plot, we'll
remove rows that have only zero values:

```python
# Remove rows with only zero values
summary_plot_data = counts_summary.loc[counts_summary.sum(axis=1)>0]
```

Now for the plotting:

```python
# Set color palette to 'Set2'
colors = sns.color_palette("Set2")
# Create a stacked barplot
ax = summary_plot_data.T.plot(kind="bar", stacked=True, color=colors)
# Move legend and set legend title
ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1,1), title="Category");
```

The final plot will be a heatmap of gene counts for a subset of the genes. We'll
select genes whose standard deviation/mean count across samples is greater than
1.5, **and** have a maximum of at least 5 reads in 1 or more sample:

```python
# Slice the dataframe to only sample counts
count_data = counts.loc[:, SRR_IDs]
# Filter to genes with std/mean > 1.2 and with a max of at least 5
heatmap_data = count_data.loc[(count_data.std(axis=1).div(count_data.mean(axis=1))>1.2)&(count_data.max(axis=1)>5)]
```

We'll also replace the SRR ids with the title of samples
used in the study, using the `name_dict` dictionary created further up in the
notebook:

```python
heatmap_data = heatmap_data.rename(columns = name_dict['title'])
```

Now let's plot the heatmap. We'll log-transform the counts, set color scale
to Blue-Yellow-Red and cluster both samples and genes using 'complete' linkage
clustering:

```python
with sns.plotting_context("notebook", font_scale=0.7):
    ax = sns.clustermap(data=np.log10(heatmap_data+1), cmap="RdYlBu_r",
                        method="complete", yticklabels=True, linewidth=.5,
                        cbar_pos=(.7, .85, .05, .1), figsize=(3,9))
    plt.setp(ax.ax_heatmap.get_xticklabels(), rotation=270)
```

In the code above we use the seaborn `plotting_context` function to scale all
text elements of the heatmap in one go.

As a final step we'll add some info for reproducibility under the
**Reproducibility** section. To add the overview image of the workflow found in
`results/rulegraph.png` we can use the `Image` function from `IPython.display`:

```python
from IPython.display import Image
Image(rulegraph_file)
```

Let's also output the full conda environment so that all packages and versions
are included in the notebook. There are several ways this can be done, for
example you could simply add:

```python
!conda list
```

to the end of the notebook.

## Sharing your work

The files you're working with come from a GitHub repo. Both GitHub and Bitbucket
can render Jupyter notebooks as well as other types of Markdown documents. Now
go to our GitHub repo at
[https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/training_reproducible_research](https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/training_reproducible_research)
and navigate to `tutorials/jupyter/supplementary_material.ipynb`.

<div align="center" markdown>
![](images/jupyter_supplementary.png){ width=700px }
</div>

As you can imagine, having this very effortless way of sharing results
can greatly increase the visibility of your work. You work as normal on
your project, and push regularly to the repository as you would anyways,
and the output is automatically available for anyone to see. Or for a
select few if you're not ready to share your findings with the world
quite yet.

Say your notebook isn't on Github/Bitbucket. All hope isn't lost there.
Jupyter.org provides a neat functionality called *nbviewer*, where you can
paste a URL to any notebook and they will render it for you. Go to
[https://nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) and try
this out with our notebook.

## Shared interactive notebooks

So far we've only shared static representations of notebooks. A strong
trend at the moment is to run your notebooks in the cloud, so that the
person you want to share with could actually execute and modify your
code. This is a great way of increasing visibility and letting
collaborators or readers get more hands-on with your data and analyses.
From a reproducibility perspective, there are both advantages and
drawbacks. On the plus side is that running your work remotely forces
you to be strict when it comes to defining the environment it uses
(probably in the form of a Conda environment or Docker image). On the
negative side is that you become reliant on a third-party service that
might change input formats, go out of business, or change payment model.

Here we will try out a service called Binder, which lets you run and
share Jupyter Notebooks in Git repositories for free. There are a number
of [example repositories](https://github.com/binder-examples/) that are
setup to be used with Binder. Navigate to
[https://github.com/binder-examples/conda/](https://github.com/binder-examples/conda/)
to see one such example. As you can see the repository contains a LICENSE
file, a README, an environment file and a notebook. To use a repository
with Binder the environment file should contain all the packages needed
to run notebooks in the repo. So let's try to run the `index.ipynb` file
using Binder:

Just go to [https://mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) and paste the link
to the GitHub repo. Note the link that you can use to share your notebook.
Then press "launch".

<div align="center" markdown>
![](images/binder.png){ width=700px }
</div>

What will happen now is that:

* Binder detects the `environment.yml` file in the root of the repo.
  Binder then builds a _Docker image_ based on the file. This might take
  a minute or two. You can follow the progress in the build log.
* Binder then launches the Jupyter Notebook server in the Docker
  container..
* ..and opens a browser tab with it for you.

Once the process is finished you will be presented with a Jupyter server
overview of the contents in the repository. Click on the `index.ipynb`
notebook to open it. Tada! You are now able to interact with (and
modify) someone else's notebook online.

Applied to your own projects you now have a way to run analyses in the
cloud and in an environment that you define yourself. All that's needed
for someone to replicate your analyses is that you share a link with
them. Note that notebooks on Binder are read-only; its purpose is for
trying out and showing existing notebooks rather than making new ones.

!!! Tip
    By default Binder looks for configuration files such as environment.yml
    in the root of the repository being built. But you may also put
    such files outside the root by making a `binder/` folder in the root
    and placing the file there.  

!!! Info "A note on transparency"
    Resources like Github/Bitbucket and Jupyter Notebooks have changed
    the way we do scientific research by encouraging visibility, social
    interaction and transparency.
    It was not long ago that the analysis scripts and workflows in a lab were
    well-guarded secrets that we only most reluctantly shared with others.
    Assuming that it was even possible. In most cases, the only postdoc who
    knew how to get it to work had left for a new position in industry, or
    no one could remember the password to the file server. If you're a PhD
    student, we encourage you to embrace this new development
    wholeheartedly, for it will make your research better and make you into
    a better scientist. And you will have more fun.

!!! Success "Quick recap"
    In this section we've learned:

    - How notebooks can be used to generate summary statistics and plots using the
    results of a workflow run
    - How to share notebooks via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) and
    [Binder](https://mybinder.org)
