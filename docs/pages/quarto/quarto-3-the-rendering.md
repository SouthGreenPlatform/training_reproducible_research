The great strength of Quarto is its diversity of rendering modes.

## Presentation 

Quarto supports a variety of formats for creating presentations, including:

- revealjs — reveal.js (HTML)
- pptx — PowerPoint (MS Office)
- beamer — Beamer (LaTeX/PDF)

The most capable format by far is revealjs so is highly recommended. For example, you can write this and render :

```r 
---
title: "Habits"
author: "John Doe"
format: revealjs
---

## Getting up

- Turn off alarm
- Get out of bed

## Going to sleep

- Get in bed
- Count sheep
```

## Websites

Quarto Websites are a convenient way to publish groups of documents. Documents published as part of a website share navigational elements, rendering options, and visual style. For example, the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/) is generated by... quarto !
