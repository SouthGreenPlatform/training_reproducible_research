To conclude this session, we offer you a demo to go further into reproducibility. We will : 

1. Create a repo on GitHub
2. Create a README and set a license
3. Add a conda file and our Jupyter notebook file
4. Update the README to explain how to edit it and use quarto to generate the page in HTML
5. Publish this page on GitHub and put it online
6. Make a release with Zenodo to have a DOI of your code
7. Set up a contributors file
8. See how to archive the repository on Software heritage
