### Create a project from scratch !

It is time to try to set up a project from scratch and use the different
tools that we have covered during the course together! This exercise is very
open-ended and you have free hands to try out a bit of what you want. But you
should aim to use what you've learned to do the following:

1. Create a new git repository for the project (either on BitBucket or GitHub)

2. Add a README file which should contain the required information on how to
   run the project

3. Create a Conda `environment.yml` file with the required dependencies

4. Create a R Markdown or Jupyter notebook to run your code

5. Alternatively, create a `Snakefile` to run your code as a workflow and use a `config.yml` file to add settings to the workflow

6. Use git to continuously commit changes to the repository

7. Possibly make a Docker or Singularity image for your project

This is not a small task and may seem overwhelming! Don't worry if you feel
lost or if the task seems daunting. To get the most out of the exercise, take
one step at a time and go back to the previous tutorials for help and
inspiration. The goal is not necessarily for you to finish the whole exercise,
but to really think about each step and how it all fits together in practice.

!!! note "Recommendation"
    We recommend to start with git, Conda and a notebook, as we would see these as
    the core tools to make a research project reproducible. We suggest to keep the
    analysis for this exercise short so that you have time to try out the different
    tools together while you have the opportunity to ask for help.

### Your own project

This is a great opportunity for you to try to implement these methods on one
of your current research projects. It is of course up to you which tools to
include in making your research project reproducible, but we suggest to aim
for at least git and Conda.

!!! tip
    If your analysis project contains computationally intense steps it may be
    good to scale them down for the sake of the exercise. You might, for
    example, subset your raw data to only contain a minuscule part of its
    original size. You can then test your implementation on the subset and only
    run it on the whole dataset once everything works to your satisfaction.

### Alternative: student experience project

If you don't want to use a project you're currently working on we have
a suggestion for a small-scale project for you. The idea is to analyze
students' experiences at this Reproducible Research course. For this you will
use responses from students to the registration form for the course. Below
you'll find links to files in `*.csv` format with answers from 3 course instances:

The goal here is to create a Snakemake workflow, which contains the following:

1. Has a rule that downloads the `csv` files (making use of a `config.yml` file
   to pass the URLs and file names)

2. Has a rule that cleans the files (making use of `wildcards` so that the same
   rule can be run on each file)

3. The final step is to plot the student experience in some way

!!! attention "Remember to"
    * Keep everything versioned controlled with `git`
    * Add information to the `README` file so others know how to re-run
      the project
    * Add required software to the Conda `environment.yml` file

### Inspiration and tips for the student experience workflow

The first two steps should be part of the Snakemake workflow. If you need some help
with the cleaning step, see below for a Python script that you can save to a file
and run in the second Snakemake rule.

??? example "Click to show a script for cleaning column names"
    The script (*e.g.* `clean_csv.py`):

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import pandas as pd
    from argparse import ArgumentParser

    def main(args):
        df = pd.read_csv(args.input, header=0)
        df.rename(columns=lambda x: x.split("[")[-1].rstrip("]"), inplace=True)
        df.rename(columns={'R Markdown': 'RMarkdown'}, inplace=True)
        df.to_csv(args.output, index=False)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        parser = ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument("input", type=str,
                            help="Input csv file")
        parser.add_argument("output", type=str,
                            help="Output csv file cleaned")
        args = parser.parse_args()
        main(args)
    ```

    Command to execute the script:

    ```
    python clean_csv.py input_file.csv output_file.csv
    ```

The third step is really up to you how to implement. You could:

* Include the plotting in the workflow using an RMarkdown document that
  gets rendered into a report
* Have a script that produces separate figures (*e.g.* `png` files)
* Create a jupyter notebook that reads the cleaned output from the workflow
  and generates some plot or does other additional analyses

If you need some help/inspiration with plotting the results, click below
to see an example Python script that you can save to file and run with
the cleaned files as input.

## To end on a high note !

To conclude this session, we offer you a demo to go further into reproducibility. We will : 

1. Create a repo on GitHub
2. Create a README and set a license
3. Add a conda file and our Jupyter notebook file
4. Update the README to explain how to edit it and use quarto to generate the page in HTML
5. Publish this page on GitHub and put it online
6. Make a release with Zenodo to have a DOI of your code
7. Set up a contributors file
8. See how to archive the repository on Software heritage

You can find a support with different screenshots if you want try it yourself ([here](https://moodle.france-bioinformatique.fr/pluginfile.php/346/course/section/47/09_expose_your_work_github.pdf))

Et voilà !
