# Data (mis)management in practice.

| **Raw data** | Data arrives in cumbersome and proprietary format. | Gets converted to format of choice. Original files (and conversion settings) are lost. | | Leads a quiet life on the HPC cluster, until the project expires and the data has to be urgently retrieved. | Ends its days on an external hard drive on the researcher's desk. | "Data available upon request". |
| **Metadata** | In researcher's lab journal. | Hard-coded in various analysis scripts. | Mailed back and forth between collaborators in ever-changing (but nicely colored) Excel sheets. | | Reformatted and included as PDF in the supplementary. | | |

# FAIR data

Strive to make your data FAIR:

- .green[**F**indable]
- .green[**A**ccessible]
- .green[**I**nteroperable] 
- .green[**R**eusable]

*for both machines and humans.*

# Data management plan

- Check requirements of funding agency and field of research.
- Determine required storage space for short and long term.
- Provide helpful metadata.
- Consider legal/ethical restrictions if working with sensitive data.
- Find suitable data repositories.
- Strive towards uploading data to its final destination already at the beginning of a project.

# Data sharing

.large[*Why Open Access?*]

+ Publicly funded research should be unrestricted.
+ Published results should be verifiable by others.
+ Enables other to build upon previous work.

*.huge[Organizing your projects]*

Which sample file represents the latest version?

```bash
$ ls -l data/
-rw-r--r--  user  staff  samples.mat
-rw-r--r--  user  staff  samplesFinal.mat
-rw-r--r--  user  staff  samplesFinalV2.mat
-rw-r--r--  user  staff  samplesUSE_THIS_ONE.mat
-rw-r--r--  user  staff  samplesV2.mat
```

# The project directory

The first step towards working reproducibly: **.green[Get organized!]**

- Divide your work into distinct projects.
- Keep all files needed to go from raw data to final results in a dedicated directory.
- Use relevant subdirectories.

# There are many ways to organize a project

One example: <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/project_template" .green[NBISweden/project_template] </a>

.small[
```bash
code/             code needed to go from input files to final results

data/             raw and primary data (never edit!)

doc/              documentation of the study

intermediate/     output files from intermediate analysis steps

logs/             logs from the different analysis steps

notebooks/        notebooks that document your day-to-day work

results/          output from workflows and analyses

scratch/          temporary files that can be safely deleted or lost

config.yml        configuration of the project workflow

Dockerfile        recipe to create a project container

environment.yml   project dependencies list used to create software environment

README.md         project description and instructions

Snakefile         workflow file used by snakemake
```

# Questions?

# Topics for discussion in breakout rooms

.large[
- Do you organize your work in distinct projects?
- How do you organize your files in this context?
- Are you happy with the way you work today?
- Does your group have a data management plan in place?
- Do you know "your" repositories and how to submit data to them?
