# What is Git?

--

* A widely used system for distributed .green[version control]

--

* Keeps a .green[complete history] of the changes you make to your files

--

* Each point in the history can be re-visited and compared with others

--

* Git tracks .green[who contributed what] to your code

--

* Git can help you .green[version, backup and share] your code and documents

--

* Kind of like Dropbox, but you decide when each version is saved (plus a lot
  of more advanced features)

--

* Git is mainly used for .green[text files], not large or binary files

---

# Git nomenclature

--

* A .green[repository] is a collection that encompasses all the files and
  directories of a project

--

* A .green[commit] is a snapshot of a repository's history, *i.e.* a point
  in development time

--

* Development can be separated into .green[branches], allowing for concurrent
  work on the same repository with simple transitions between functional and
  work-in-progress code

--

* Uploading changes to a remote repository is called .green[pushing], while
  downloading changes is called .green[pulling]

# Tracking code in three steps

<br>

--

1. Do some .green[coding] (*i.e.* add or change contents of files)

--

2. .green[Stage] the changes (*i.e.* specify which changes should be stored)

--

3. .green[Commit] the changes (storing them in the repository's history)

---

# Git is highly versatile

* Ensures .green[reproducibility] of your analyses, regardless of whether youâ€™ve
  made additional changes to your code after the analysis is run

--

* Easily .green[fix mistakes] by reverting files to previous versions

--

* Improves your coding by giving you .green[additional structure]

--

* Your code has a .green[backup] in your remote repository

--

* Easily .green[share your code] and collaborate with your colleagues
