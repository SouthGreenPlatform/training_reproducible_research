Take control of your research project <br>
by making its different components reproducible

By working reproducibly you will also make your life a lot easier!

# What have we learned?

<center><img src="../../pages/images/reproducibility_overview_with_logos.png" style="width:60%;"/></center>

* How to use the version control system .green[Git] to track changes to code
* How to use the package and environment manager .green[Conda]
* How to use the workflow managers .green[Snakemake] and .green[Nextflow]
* How to use .green[R Markdown] and .green[Jupyter] to generate automated reports and to document your analyses
* How to use .green[Docker] and .green[Singularity] to distribute containerized
  computational environments

---

# Divide your work into distinct projects

--

* Keep all .green[files] needed to go from raw data to final results in a dedicated directory

--

* Use relevant .green[subdirectories]

--

* Many software support the “project way of working”, *e.g.* .green[Rstudio] and the text editors .green[Sublime Text] and .green[Atom]

--

* Use .green[Git] to create structured and version controlled project repositories

---

# Everything can be a project

Project directory templates, *e.g.* NBIS project template:

.center[<img src="NBISweden_project_template.png" style="width:60%;"/>]

  * https://github.com/NBISweden/project_template
  * https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/cookiecutter-snakemake-workflow

---

# Treasure your data

--

* Keep your input data .green[read-only] - consider it static

--

* Don't create different versions of the input data - write a .green[script],
  .green[R Markdown] document, .green[Jupyter] notebook or a .green[Snakemake]
  / .green[Nextflow] workflow if you need to pre-process your input data so that
  the steps can be recreated

--

* .green[Backup]! Keep redundant copies in different physical locations

--

* Upload your raw data as soon as possible to a .green[public data repository]

---

# Organize your coding

--

* Avoid generating files .green[interactively] or doing things .green[by hand]

  - there is no way to track how they were made

--

* Write .green[scripts], .green[R Markdown] documents, .green[Jupyter]
  notebooks or .green[Snakemake] / .green[Nextflow] workflows for reproducible
  results to connect raw data to final results

--

* Keep the .green[parameters] separate (*e.g.* at top of file or in a separate configuration file)

---

# What is reasonable for your project?

.pull-left[<center><img src="../../pages/images/reproducibility_overview_with_logos.png" style="width:75%;"/></center>

.green[Minimal]: write code in a reproducible way

]

--

.pull-right[

Connect your results with the code:
* Use .green[R Markdown] documents or .green[Jupyter] notebooks

Take another step:
* Convert your code into a .green[Snakemake] / .green[Nextflow] workflow

]

---

# What is reasonable for your project?

.pull-left[<center><img src="../../pages/images/reproducibility_overview_with_logos.png" style="width:75%;"/></center>

.green[Minimal]: write code in a reproducible way

.green[Good]: versioned and structured repository

]

--

.pull-right[

Use .green[Git] for version controlling and collaboration:
* Create one .green[Git] repository per project
* Track your changes with .green[Git]
* Publish your code along with your results on *e.g.* <a href="https://github.com" .green[GitHub] </a>

.green[Minimal]: write code in a reproducible way

.green[Good]: versioned and structured repository

.green[Better]: organize software dependencies

]

--

.pull-right[

Manage your depencencies:
* Use .green[Conda] to install software in environments that can be easily exported and installed on a different system

# What is reasonable for your project?

.green[Better]: organize software dependencies

.green[Best]: export everything!

]

--

.pull-right[

Completely recreate the compute system:
* Consider packaging your project inside a or together with a .green[Docker] or .green[Singularity] container

# Alternatives

--

.green[Version control]

* **Git** – Widely used and a lot of tools available + GitHub/BitBucket.
* **Mercurial** – Distributed model just like Git, close to sourceforge.
* **Subversion** – Centralized model unlike git/mercurial; no local repository on your computer and somewhat easier to use.

---

# Alternatives

.green[Environment / package managers]

* **Conda** – General purpose environment and package manager. Community-hosted collections of tools at bioconda or conda-forge.
* **Pip** – Package manager for Python, has a large repository at pypi.
* **Apt/yum/brew** – Native package managers for different OS. Integrated in OS and might deal with *e.g.* update notifications better.
* **Virtualenv** – Environment manager used to set up semi-isolated python environments.

---

# Alternatives

.green[Workflow managers]

* **Snakemake** – Based on Python, easily understandable format, relies on file names.
* **Nextflow** – Based on Groovy, uses data pipes rather than file names to construct the workflow.
* **Make** – Used in software development and has been around since the 70s. Flexible but notoriously obscure syntax.
* **Galaxy** -  attempts to make computational biology accessible to researchers without programming experience by using a GUI.

---

# Alternatives

.green[Literate programming]

* **Jupyter** – Create and share notebooks in a variety of languages and formats by using a web browser.
* **R Markdown** – Developed by Rstudio, focuses on generating high-quality documents.
* **Zeppelin** – Developed by Apache. Closely integrated with Spark for distributed computing and Big Data applications.
* **Beaker** – Newcomer based on Ipython, just as Jupyter. Has a focus on integrating multiple languages in the same notebook.

---

# Alternatives

.green[Containerization / virtualization]

* **Docker** – Used for packaging and isolating applications in containers. Dockerhub allows for convenient sharing. Requires root access.
* **Singularity** – Simpler Docker alternative geared towards high performance computing. Does not require root.
* **Shifter** – Similar ambition as Singularity, but less focus on mobility and more on resource management.
* **VirtualBox/VMWare** – Virtualization rather than containerization. Less lightweight, but no reliance on host kernel.
